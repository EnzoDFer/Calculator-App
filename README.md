# Calculator-App
Scientific Calculator - made using React

This is my second application made using React and as part of my odin project curriculum.
One of my major improvements coming from my last application, the sketch app, is learning
how to use the useReducer hook as a tool to handle the various types of operations and
inputs necessary.
